# Advent of Code

https://adventofcode.com/

Commentary for each year is in YEAR.md

My todo list of languages to try and do this in is

* Java
* Haskell
  * Lots of the problems lend themselves nicely to Haskell. The main holdup is that I don't know much about IO or QoL stuff like regex in Haskell
* Python
* Typescript/Javascript (on Node)
