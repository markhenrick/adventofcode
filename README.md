# Advent of Code

https://adventofcode.com/

I've deliberately written a lot of the code in a deliberately convoluted or unusual style to make it more interesting, so it's very far removed from code I'd ever write for production or for other people to work on. Most frequently, I've tried to force Java to look like Haskell, to varying degrees of success...

Commentary for each year is in YEAR.md

My todo list of languages to try and do this in is

* Java
* Haskell
  * Lots of the problems lend themselves nicely to Haskell. The main holdup is that I don't know much about IO or QoL stuff like regex in Haskell
* Python
* Typescript/Javascript (on Node)
